# SmartHome-RemoteControl
Open-Source Remote-Control for Smarthome (especially Home-cinema) use based on Arduino, ESP32, HTML and other technologies.

The software is tailored to the needs of my use-case. It is not intended to be universal for every possible need, but feel free to build your own individual solution on top.

It consists of a server part running on a stationary Raspberry Pi (or similar) and several portable thin-clients to monitor and control the system.
